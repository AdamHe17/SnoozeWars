##Project Description
Snooze Wars is an Android mobile application that aims to wake users up in the morning by instigating a snooze war between two users waking up at the same time.
When one user snoozes, the other user's alarm goes off. This continues until one of them moves their phone a long distance from their bed, hence actually getting up.
If one user wakes up, the other can no longer snooze, and the alarm will ring until he or she gets up as well.

##Project Status
In Progress, currently at the Hackathon.
